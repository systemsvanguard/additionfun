# Addition Fun

Test your math addition skills and have fun.  How far can you go? Built initially as a fun way for my son to increase his addition speed AND for Pops and son to have fun playing together on winter days; ashamed to admit he consistently scores higher than me, even to this day.   
Built using jQuery, jQuery UI, Bootstrap 3, Fontastic icons, Google fonts, CSS, & HTML5.  Enjoy!
